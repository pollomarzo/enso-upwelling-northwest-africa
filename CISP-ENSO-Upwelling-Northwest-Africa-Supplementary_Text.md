# Alternate experiment:

In this set of analyses the SST data were first filtered to retain only interannual variations. Subsequently a Promax (power 4) rotated complex maximum covariance analysis (CMCA) analysis ([](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-21-0244.1))  was carried out between central Pacific and eastern tropical north Atlantic SSTs to identify linked modes of variation. This method relies on a singular value decomposition of the cross-covariance matrix which separates the modes of variations under the condition that the leading modes explain most of the spatial cross-covariance between the two fields. While an MCA analysis ordinarily identifies coherent linked variations in the data fields, a complex MCA is able to detect lagged covariations using a Hilbert transform.

The modes identified through this analysis illustrated a 270 degree difference between Pacific and Coastal Atlantic SST distributions. The frequency filtering makes the signal fairly "monochromatic" with maximum amplitude around 0.25 cycles/year. Thus, this analysis identified modes consisting of a lag of approximately 3 years. Such high lags are difficult to explain through established teleconnection mechanisms, and the results of this experiment are rejected.

The frequency filtering aided this analysis by restricting the spectra to a narrow frequency band. This allowed a simple estimation of lag in terms of time (from lag in terms of phase.) However, it is possible that the frequency filtering obscures lead lag relations and therefore produces inaccurate CMCA modes.
